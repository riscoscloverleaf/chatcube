<p>
TBX is a C++ class library to help with the creation of RISC OS applications
that use the RISC OS Toolbox modules.
</p>
<p>
This is version 0.7.5 (Alpha version). It has a few missing features and may contain
some rough edges and bugs. Please send me feedback to improve this library.
Contact details are in the !TBX application Help file.
</p>
<p>TBX is released under the permissive X11 licence so can be used
with commercial and non-commercial applications without charge.</p>
<p>
TBX is provided as a Package named TBX-Dev for the the
<A HREF="http://www.riscpkg.org">RISC OS Packaging Project</A>.
</p>
<p>Two additional packages have also been provided</p>
<ul>
<li>TBX-Examples - simple examples showing some of the features of TBX</li>
<li>TbxAppGen - an application to generate shell TBX based applications that
you can then add your own code to.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition for C++ and Toolbox developement you will need</p>
<ul>
<li>GCC4 for compiling C++ programs from <a href="http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCC_for_RISC_OS">GCC for RISC OS at www.riscos.info</a></li>
